Inside `dftegrity.dunits` there is a subpackage called `dateinfer`

**This package was not created by me**, it was created by **@jeffreystar** and source can be found at [https://github.com/jeffreystarr/dateinfer](https://github.com/jeffreystarr/dateinfer)

The reason this package is embedded as source instead of being sourced from PyPi is because there are early version python relative imports that make the package **unusable in its distributed state**

**The only modifications to the version here are the relative imports have been updated - all credit for the package goes to @jeffreystar**
